## Overview
This document describes the architecture and design decisions for the Raspberry Pi Mini SOC project.  
The system is built on a single Raspberry Pi and focuses on collecting, storing, and visualising security-related logs generated by a honeypot.

The overall goal of the project is to demonstrate core SOC concepts such as monitoring, log analysis, and alerting using lightweight, open-source tools suitable for limited hardware.

## Operating System: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (ARM64)

Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS was chosen as the operating system for this project for stability, compatibility, and long-term support.

### Long-Term Support and Reliability
Ubuntu Server LTS releases receive security updates and bug fixes for several years. This makes it suitable for a security monitoring system that is expected to run continuously without frequent major upgrades.

### Compatibility with Security Tools
Cowrie, Loki, and Grafana are well supported on Ubuntu-based systems. Using Ubuntu reduces setup complexity and allows the project to follow common installation and configuration practices found in documentation and tutorials.

### Server-Focused Design
Ubuntu Server does not include a graphical desktop environment by default. This keeps the system lightweight and better suited to running background services such as log collectors and dashboards.

## Hardware Architecture: ARM64

The project runs on ARM64 architecture due to the use of a Raspberry Pi.

### Efficient Use of Limited Resources
ARM64 is designed to be power efficient while still providing enough performance to run multiple services. This makes it suitable for continuous monitoring and logging on a small, low-power device.

### Realistic Edge Security Scenario
ARM-based devices are commonly used for edge computing and security appliances. Running a SOC-style project on ARM64 reflects real-world scenarios where monitoring tools are deployed outside traditional data centres.

### Software Support
All components used in this project support ARM64, allowing the system to run natively without the need for emulation or workarounds.

## Headless Operation

The system is operated entirely in headless mode, with no local graphical interface.

### Reduced Attack Surface
By not installing a desktop environment, fewer services and packages are exposed. This helps reduce potential vulnerabilities on the system.

### Resource Conservation
Running without a GUI saves CPU, memory, and storage, which is important on hardware with limited resources.

### Practical Administration
All administration tasks are performed over SSH or through the Grafana web interface. This reflects how servers and monitoring systems are commonly managed in real environments.

## Honeypot Component: Cowrie

Cowrie is used as the primary data source for security events in this project.

### Purpose of the Honeypot
Cowrie is a low-interaction SSH and Telnet honeypot designed to attract and log malicious activity such as:
- Brute-force login attempts
- Use of common or weak credentials
- Commands entered by attackers after login

### Deployment Approach
Cowrie runs on non-standard ports and under a dedicated, non-privileged user account. This ensures that attacker interaction is isolated and does not provide access to the underlying system.

### Log Generation
Cowrie generates structured JSON logs that capture session details, credentials attempted, commands executed, and source IP addresses. These logs form the primary input for analysis and visualisation.

---

## Log Storage: Loki

Loki is used as the central log storage backend for the project.

### Lightweight Log Management
Loki is designed to be more lightweight than traditional log indexing systems. It stores logs as raw data and relies on labels for organisation, making it suitable for small-scale environments.

### JSON Log Support
Cowrie logs are already in JSON format, which allows them to be ingested into Loki with minimal transformation.

### Label-Based Organisation
Logs are labelled by source, service, and event type. This makes it easier to filter and query honeypot activity during analysis.

---

## Visualisation and Alerts: Grafana

Grafana is used to visualise honeypot activity and generate alerts.

### Dashboards
Grafana dashboards display:
- Login attempts over time
- Most common usernames and passwords
- Source IP addresses and countries
- Commands executed in honeypot sessions

These dashboards provide quick visibility into attacker behaviour.

### Alerting
Basic alert rules are configured in Grafana to trigger notifications when certain thresholds are exceeded, such as:
- High volumes of failed login attempts
- Repeated access from a single IP address

This introduces alerting concepts commonly used in SOC environments.

---

## Security Baseline Summary

A basic security baseline was applied to the Raspberry Pi before deploying the SOC components.

### System Hardening
- Strong passwords and restricted user access
- SSH access enabled only where required
- Regular system updates applied

### Network Controls
- Firewall enabled with only required ports open
- Honeypot services exposed on non-standard ports

### Service Isolation
- Cowrie runs as a non-root user
- Logging and visualisation services are separated logically

## Architectural Summary

This project demonstrates how a simple SOC-style monitoring setup can be built on a single, low-cost device.  
By combining a honeypot, centralised logging, and visualisation, the system provides insight into real-world attack behaviour while remaining safe and manageable.

Although the architecture is intentionally small-scale, the concepts used are directly applicable to larger SOC and security monitoring environments.
